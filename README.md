# Suicide-Rates-Overview

This was the final project for my Data Science undergraduate course. This was done in a group of 5.  

The project is divided into two notebooks:
	1.	Data Cleaning + Phase 1 of EDA: cleaning the dataset, filtering the dataset and plotting trends as part of EDA
	2.	Phase 2 of EDA (Hypothesis testing): hypothesis testing being done for the generation, gender and age features

A detailed walk-through of the project and the conclusions drawn is given in the following blogpost: https://medium.com/@sabarehman1998/31c56f19a3bd.
